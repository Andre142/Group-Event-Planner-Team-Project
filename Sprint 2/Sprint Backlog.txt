We want to work on the feature of searching for events and sending proposals in this sprint, because we think this functionality is the most crucial part of the project. Other features like user’s privacy settings and accepting or declining proposals will build on this feature. Thus, we would like to give priority to developing this core feature. We’re also doing minor changes to our login / sign up UI to complete the feature we started last sprint.
