Retrospective


Attendants: Ryan, Kevin, Yang, Jack


Process Changes:
- Mock objects to get coverage for catch blocks so we can test our catch blocks
- Mock API requests (avoids the occasional travis error due to API issues) so we don’t see failing builds when nothing is wrong
- Double check our sprint/scrum documents to make sure we meet requirements and are up to date (like changes in the task chart) and with all relevant information (like attendants in the sprint backlog)


New Task(s) Added to Product Backlog:
- Add an additional criteria, Genre, to search for events
- Show more than 10 results (unlimited*)
   * We need to negotiate the “unlimited” quality of this feature because we cannot feasibly return infinite results
- The loading time for searching for events should be less than 1.5 seconds*
   * We need to negotiate this feature because it’s infeasible to return unlimited results in a fixed quantity of time


Feedback to Address:
- Add an additional criteria, Genre, to search for events
- Show more than 10 results (unlimited*)
   * We need to negotiate the “unlimited” quality of this feature because we cannot feasibly return infinite results
- We need to negotiate about the requirement that the system must pick an event EVERYONE can attend even if someone says he’s unavailable, which is not reasonable. 
- The loading time for searching for events should be less than 1.5 seconds
   * Use acceptance test to make sure this criteria is satisfied
   * We need to negotiate this feature because it’s infeasible to return unlimited results in a fixed quantity of time
- Make sure our process changes (above) have explanations as to why we are making those changes
- We should be more careful when writing units tests so that TDD process is correctly followed
- We need to add attendants to the sprint backlog next time
