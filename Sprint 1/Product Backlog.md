Sprint Backlog 1

- Docker container environment setup 
- Database setup 
- Frontend setup 
- Login page 
- Sign up page

Participants: Kevin Wang, Jack Mandelkorn, Yang Yue, Ryan Wei

We chose these tasks because most of them are items that we need to complete before starting other tasks—setting up the environment/database and creating theme files. We also add the creation of some of the less complex pages as we feel like we can complete that this sprint.
