| Sprint Planning          | 4.5/9               | The product backlog and sprint backlog seem to have been reversed. I assessed one point penalty on each for that (-2).  The product backlog should be more or less the same as the feature list at this point, but it is missing many things (-1).  The task chart does not match what I believe is intended to be the sprint backlog (-1.5). |
